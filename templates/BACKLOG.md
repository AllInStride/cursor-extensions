## How to Use This Backlog

This is the holding area for work that hasn't been scheduled into a phase yet. Items here are acknowledged but not committed to. During phase planning, pull items from here into the Task Tracker.

**Priority Guide:**
- **P0** — Must have, schedule ASAP
- **P1** — Should have, schedule in next phase
- **P2** — Nice to have, schedule when capacity allows
- **P3** — Someday/maybe, revisit quarterly
