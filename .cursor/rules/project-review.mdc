# Project Review Command

When the user asks you to run a "project review" or "/project-review", follow this workflow:

## Step 1: Locate and Read Project Documents

Find and read these documents (check `docs/` and project root):
- **PRD** (PRD.md) — requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Architecture Doc** (ARCHITECTURE.md) — system design and tech stack
- **Implementation Plan** (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) — phases, steps, definitions of done
- **Task Tracker** (TASK_TRACKER.md) — checkable task list with progress
- **Decision Log** (DECISION_LOG.md) — decisions made and open questions

If any document is missing, note it as a gap.

## Step 2: Scan Codebase for Quality Issues

Search the codebase for:

**Stub/Incomplete Markers:** `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX`, `STUB`, `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`, empty function bodies, functions that only throw "not implemented", hardcoded placeholder returns.

**Fake Data & Mock Drift:** In-memory databases used as production substitutes, hardcoded test data outside test files (`"test123"`, `"foo"`, `"bar"`), mock services that should be real integrations, placeholder seed data.

**Placeholder Patterns:** `console.log` as error handling, empty catch blocks, large commented-out code blocks, boilerplate-only files.

## Step 3: Cross-Reference Task Tracker

- For `[x]` tasks: verify referenced files exist with real implementations
- For `[ ]` tasks: check if implementation exists but tracker is out of date
- Flag mismatches between tracker and codebase
- Check if phase exit criteria are actually met

## Step 4: Compile Open Questions

- List all "Proposed" decisions and open questions from DECISION_LOG.md
- Flag decisions blocking tasks
- Identify code areas suggesting unmade decisions

## Step 5: Generate Progress Report

Create `reports/PROGRESS_REPORT_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` containing:
- Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
- Document Status table (found, last updated, health)
- Progress by Phase (tasks complete, exit criteria met, issues)
- Outstanding Items (remaining tasks, stubs, tracker mismatches)
- Decisions Needed
- Recommendations (prioritized)
- What's Next (concrete next steps)
- What's Left (remaining work by phase)

## Rules

- Reference exact file paths and line numbers
- A checked task with a stub implementation is NOT done
- Every finding must have an actionable next step
- Be honest about project health
