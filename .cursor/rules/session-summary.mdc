# Session Summary Command

When the user asks to "summarize session", "/session-summary", or "wrap up", generate an end-of-session summary that captures context for continuity and updates project documents.

## Step 1: Analyze the Session

Review the conversation and extract:

**What happened:** Session goal, project path, what was accomplished (specific files/features/fixes), what's in progress, exact point where work stopped.

**Decisions:** Choices made, rationale, alternatives rejected.

**Problems:** Errors encountered, how resolved, what was tried that didn't work, remaining blockers.

**Learnings:** Project knowledge gained, user preferences observed, technical insights.

## Step 2: Update Project Documents

If the project uses the standard document set, update:

**Task Tracker** — Check off completed tasks, update in-progress status, add discovered tasks, update summary counts.

**Decision Log** — Add new decisions (DEC-XXX), resolve open questions, add new questions.

**Backlog** — Add ideas, tech debt, future work found during session.

**Test Plan** — Update test statuses, add new test cases, log test runs.

Skip documents that don't exist.

## Step 3: Write Session Summary

Save to `~/.claude/sessions/<project-name>_<YYYY-MM-DD>_<HH-MM>.md`:

Contents:
- Session metadata (date, project, duration context)
- Goal and accomplishments
- In-progress items and exact pickup point
- Decisions table (decision, choice, rationale, rejected alternatives)
- What didn't work (failed approaches — prevents repeating)
- Blockers and open questions
- Learnings (project knowledge, user preferences, technical insights)
- Documents updated checklist
- Next session priorities (numbered, specific)

## Step 4: Update Persistent Memory

Read `~/.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` or project auto-memory. Promote only durable cross-session insights: consistent user preferences, architecture patterns, tool gotchas, workflow patterns.

Don't add: session-specific details, resolved temp blockers, one-off decisions.

Keep MEMORY.md under 200 lines. Remove entries this session proved wrong.

## Step 5: Meta-Reflection

Add to the summary:
- What worked well this session (approach, communication, tools)
- What could improve (lost time, miscommunication, wrong assumptions)
- Which memory entries were useful vs noise

## Step 6: Show Compact Summary

```
Session saved: ~/.claude/sessions/<filename>.md
Accomplished: [1-2 lines]
Pick up next: [1 line]
Docs updated: [list]
Memory updated: [what changed]
```

## Rules

- Always write the file — even short sessions matter
- Be specific about pickup point (file, function, state)
- Capture what didn't work, not just what did
- Observe user preferences, don't assume them
- MEMORY.md stays under 200 lines
- Never edit/delete previous session files
